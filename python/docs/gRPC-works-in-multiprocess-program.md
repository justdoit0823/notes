gRPC
=====

gRPC is a grpc framework developed by google, which supports a lot of programming languages such as `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Go`, `Ruby`, `C#`, `Node.js`, `Android Java`, `Objective-C`, `PHP`.
The client communicates to the server with [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) protocol. So it's decoupled, and easy to write client programs in a different language as the server.

For the more details, you can go to [What is gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/)


Run gRPC in multiprocess program
================================

Recently in grpcio 1.6.3, I got a problem when using gRPC in multiprocess Python program. If the channel is globally initialized, the gRPC call would hang in the child process. However the same program works well with grpcio 1.4.0 .
Later, I found something in gRPC's github issues, such as [gRPC Python 1.6.0 Library Incompatibility with `fork()`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/12455). From a contributor, I got some details.
>We intend to support fork() going forward for the 1.7 release.

>The 1.6 release introduced more background threads at the c-level, which are not carried over to child processes after the fork() call.

>In the interim, pinning grpcio==1.4.0 is the best workaround.

First, the gRPC essentially doesn't support `fork`, which means it doesn't guarantee safety in multiprocess programs. Second, more background threads introduced in 1.6 makes this problem arised.
But why a multithread program can't work correctly with `fork`?


Fork in multithread program
---------------------------

There is an old blog [deadlock-after-fork-in-python](https://github.com/justdoit0823/notes/blob/master/python/docs/deadlock-after-fork-in-python.md) about how a program works incorrectly after `fork` in Python.

### The essence of fork ###

>The child process is created with a single threadâ€”the one that called fork().
>The entire virtual address space of the parent is replicated in the child, including the states of mutexes, condition variables, and other pthreads objects.


So in a multithreading program, after fork, a child process is a single thread program with possible lock resources which were used in other nonexistent threads.
In some situation, this may be fortunately ok. Otherwise there is a big pitfall for you without attention.
